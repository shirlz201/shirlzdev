<section><h2> <em>About Me </em></h2>

<p>Hello! My name is Shirley Sosa. I live in Kearny, NJ. I'm Peruvian. I'm bilingual, English and Spanish. I have my bachelors in Marketing from 
Montclair State University. </p>

<p>I'm a student at Laguardia Community College under their TechHire Open Code program. I'm an aspiring web developer and look forward to taking this next step in becoming
    a web developer and obtain a job in tech!
</p>

<h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>

<p>I worked as a pharmacy technician at an independent pharmacy for over 6 years. Initially, I wanted to pursue a career in Pharmaceutical marketing. After attending a coding workshop
    at my old school, it inspired me to look into the tech field further. I love to problem solve and challenge myself. I started taking a few courses on Codecademy and realized
    that this is something I enjoy doing and want to learn more.
</p>

<p> After I quit my job at the pharmacy, I wanted to have a different experience in working for another company. I worked for HelloFresh as a customer care agent for a year. There was no 
opportunity for growth and listening to complaints all day was mentally draining. I quit. I didn't want to fall into the pattern of "settling" and did research online for coding bootcamps
and came across the TechHire Open Code Program!
</p>

<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
<p>My hobbies are photography, painting, drawing, yoga and traveling. I enjoy taking pictures of people and anything that's picture worthy to my eyes.
    When it comes to painting, anything with cartoons or scenic. I'm always looking for something new or fun to enjoy  </p>
<p>Back in 2014, through Montclair State, I was chosen to attend a 10 day trip to China. Every since, it motivated me to save up and travel to a new country every year.
    My most recent trip was Spain, I visited Madrid and it was so much fun. I booked my stay at a hostel which was shared. I went by myself, used the AirBnB experience feature and it led me to meet new people.
    I never felt alone. I encourage anyone to at least travel by themselves at least once, it's a different experience and something that you can cherish for years to come.
